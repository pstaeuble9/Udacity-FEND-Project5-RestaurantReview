## Project Overview

This is #6 student project made for Udacity classroom on Front-End Web Developer track.

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, students have to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, this project is a static design that lacks accessibility and need to convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. There is also need to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

#### Specification

Student has been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Student job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

#### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.

#### Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Student needs to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

## How to Run Application

#### Possible choices:

**1**. Open live project [here](https://dominicom.github.io/restaurant-review-app/).

**2**. Or run it on your local machine:
* download or clone the repository
* next follow these [instructions](#instructions)



### Instructions
**Running application on local machine**

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
